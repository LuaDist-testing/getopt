Installation instructions:
**************************

You want to use luarocks. You can install this with a simple

   # luarocks make rockspec/getopt-1.0.0-1.rockspec

There is an included Makefile, which did work the last time I tested
it; it's messy, error prone, and requires that you edit it to suit
your environment. YMMV.

*****
Bugs:
*****

* There is no test suite.

* Much of this code is repurposed from my lua-cyrussasl module. Which
  means it should be abstracted in some common way, rather than
  copy-and-pasted.
